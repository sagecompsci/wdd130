            <p>My name is Sage Reid. I live in the U.S. in the state of Utah. I moved here from Washington state about
                4 years ago. I like it here a lot better because we lived in Kennewick which was very dry and full of
                sagebrush. I really love the snow which is part of why I love Utah so much. In my free time I mostly
                play video games. My favorite games are Breath of the Wild and Stardew Valley. I also enjoy Minecraft,
                Nier Automata, Spiritfarer and all LEGO games. I have always loved reading and my favorite series is
                the Inheritance Cycle. I have read it probably 10 times. My family includes my mom and dad and 3
                brothers.2 of my brothers are older and since I didn't have any sisters I had a bit of a hard time when
                I was little. I now have a sister-in-law and I love her so much! We also have 2 cats. Their names are
                Iroh and Korra. We named them from Avatar the Last Airbender. I love my cats and really enjoy snuggling
                with them. They bring so much joy into my life.</p>
